If you want to run/send emails everyday from 9am to 8PM every 20 minutes:

20,40,59 9-20 * * * python ~/climine/climail.py

If you want to run it in the linux.student.cs environment, some tweaking is required like changing the directory where the txt
is stored (preferably the climine directory) and changing to the climine directory before running the script.

On the linux.student.cs environment, your cron job will look like this: 
20,40,59 9-20 * * * cd ~/climine&&python climail.py
